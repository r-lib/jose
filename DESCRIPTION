Description: A collection of specifications to securely transfer claims such as
    authorization information between parties. A JSON Web Token (JWT) contains
    claims used by systems to apply access control rules to its resources. One
    potential use case of the JWT is authentication and authorization for a
    system that exposes resources through OAuth 2.0.
